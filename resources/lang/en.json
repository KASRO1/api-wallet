    "and what is IDO": "and what is IDO?",
    "IDO1": "Essentially, IDO is a new crowdfunding method and a reliable way to launch projects or raise funds for growth and development. Every day, new projects emerge in the crypto space that want to attract investors to realize their ideas. Projects create favorable conditions, sell some tokens at an early stage, which allows participants to profit from resale in a fairly short period of time.",
    "IDO2": "The IDO model has gained popularity because crypto projects can raise funds through liquidity pools without intermediaries, and investors can benefit from instant trading of tokens, which is essentially a win-win situation for everyone. Investing in IDO can be an opportunity for investors to access investments in projects at an early stage, when the token price may be lower than after they appear on centralized exchanges. Also, investors can get greater liquidity since tokens are already traded on decentralized exchanges. IDO takes place within the liquidity pool on the decentralized exchange, which means that the token price is determined by supply and demand in the market.",
    "IDO3": "APY Launch - selects quality projects, places them on their platform, and allows users to participate in early token purchases through whitelists.",
    "IDO4": "Platform users have access to guaranteed allocations - when an investor is whitelisted to purchase a certain portion of tokens. To do this, they need to lock their APY ecosystem tokens in staking.",
    "IDO5": "Cryptocurrency IDO has several advantages, including:",
    "IDO6": "1. Accessibility for everyone: IDO allows anyone to invest in projects without restrictions based on geography or investor status.<br /><br />2. Direct access to projects: IDO provides direct access for investors to projects, bypassing intermediaries and centralized exchanges.<br /><br />3. Greater liquidity: IDO takes place on decentralized exchanges where project tokens can be traded immediately after the IDO. This can provide greater liquidity for project tokens.<br /><br />4. Lower fees: IDO is conducted on decentralized exchanges, which can lower fees for investors compared to centralized exchanges.",
    "IDO7": "The IDO model has already proven its effectiveness. To maximize this effectiveness for everyone, the project's task is to make this move at the right moment.",

Participation in voting and decision-making: some blockchain networks allow their participants to vote for various changes and decisions related to the network's development. Users who stake their assets in such networks can participate in voting and contribute to decision-making.<br /><br />3. Protection against volatility: staking cryptocurrency can be a way to protect against price volatility in the market. Users who stake their assets can receive income in the form of tokens, which can help reduce the risks of market price volatility.<br /><br />4. Increase in security level: staking cryptocurrency can help increase the network's security level. The more users stake their assets, the more protected the network becomes against potential attacks and manipulations.<br /><br />5. Participation in blockchain network development: staking cryptocurrency can be a way for users to actively participate in the development of the blockchain network. Users who stake their assets can support the network's functionality and contribute to its development, which can have a positive effect on the long-term token value.<br /><br />6.

    "liq_info2": "Liquidity pools are essentially token repositories that facilitate the trading process of a specific currency pair by receiving liquidity from users, who in turn receive rewards from the project based on the share they have invested.",
    "liq_info3": "For example, imagine you want to exchange token A for token B. You can add your tokens A and B to a liquidity pool in the appropriate proportions, and other users can exchange tokens with each other using this liquidity pool. With each trade, users receive their share of the liquidity pool.",
    "liq_info4": "The liquidity pool mechanism uses an Automated Market Maker (AMM) algorithm for price setting. This means that the token price in the liquidity pool changes automatically and depends on the token proportions in the pool. When demand for one token increases, its price goes up, and the price of the other token goes down to maintain balance in the pool.",
    "liq_info5": "Each user who adds tokens to the liquidity pool receives their proportional income from all trades in that pool. The income can be paid out in tokens deposited in the pool or other tokens that can be used on the same exchange or exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.",
    "liq_info6": "Investing in liquidity pools can provide users with the opportunity to earn income from trading on a DEX while providing liquidity for token exchange. It can also be a way to protect against token price volatility since users earn income from both price increases and decreases.",
    "liq_info7": "In addition to rewards for farming, APY pools also have a liquidity fee for providers from each trading procedure.

Payment of fees for internal payments, conversions within the APY wallet, claiming rewards, opening deposits for staking, and requesting withdrawals.<br /><br />3. Investing in the project - the token is used to invest in the project and earn profit from its further development.<br /><br />4. APY staking - for access to premium wallet features.<br /><br />5. Voting and participation in decision-making: APY coin gives the right to participate in decision-making regarding certain aspects of the platform. This includes making decisions about the platform's further development, changing the rules of platform usage, etc.<br /><br />6. Airdrops and rewards for APY token holders.",
    "APY_info5": "APY is a deflationary token, its total supply is reduced to a certain amount.<br />The reduction in supply is achieved through the buyback and burning of tokens 🔥<br />We will burn 70% of the total APY issuance because:<br />✔️ Burning allows us to use resources that could negatively affect the APY token price <br />✔️ Holding APY will become more profitable as more tokens are burned<br />✔️ The issuance decreases, and the market capitalization increases",

They are good in that they provide automatic execution of transactions in\n                                compliance with predetermined conditions for their execution. DeFi-staking differs from\n                                the usual one in that third parties are involved in the process. For example, it can be\n                                organizations or individual users who take the coins from the owner at an interest rate.\n                                Meaning that they are credited.",

But in any case, it is advisable to check the level of effectiveness\n                                of the individual smart contract. Theoretically, there could be vulnerabilities in\n                                it.",
    "defi_info4": "DeFi-staking attracts users for several reasons:<br>Fast profit accrual. Нou can\n                                immediately withdraw your interest, which is accrued every day, within a day. You do\n                                not have to wait a month for the payment.<br>Higher profitability. The interest in\n                                DeFi-staking is higher and the entry threshold is lower. When working with\n                                conventional blockchains, using PoS, it is difficult to earn more than 10% per year.\n                                By choosing DeFi, a user can expect a return of 100% per annum or more. It all\n                                depends on the chosen coin and term.<br>Guaranteed Payouts. One example is Binance\n                                BNB Staking. The user is protected from fraud not only by smart contracts, but also\n                                by the authority of the platform itself.<br>Staking continues to be a popular form\n                                of earning because it provides a good level of profit and does not involve high\n                                risks.<br>When it comes to profitability in general, the bottom line is determined\n                                by the choice of coin, the length of time it is placed, and the type of staking.\n                                Different users may have very different percentages. But in any case, coin holders\n                                will receive their reward. Here everything is more stable in comparison to mining.In\n                                some projects, only users who have been selected as validators are rewarded. But for\n                                this in any case you need to have a large amount in your account.<br>Sometimes users\n                                go the alternative way - merge their crypto resources into one pool. This allows\n                                them to become validators even without having enough amount in their account.

    "referral5": "4. Different reward levels: customers receive different reward levels depending on the level of their partners.
